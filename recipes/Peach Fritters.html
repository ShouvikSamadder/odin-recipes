    <p>Making fresh peach fritters with chunks of peaches in a peach batter instead of chunks of peaches in a plain batter changes everything. These fritters are pure peach goodness. Serve with vanilla ice cream and Bourbon whiskey syrup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 generous cup cubed fresh peach (about 1 very large, or 2 small peaches)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Add cubed peaches to a bowl and toss well with 2 tablespoons sugar. Coverand let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Peaches will release their juice and a syrup will form at the bottom of the bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Stir vanilla extract, nutmeg, cinnamon, and panko breadcrumbs into peaches. Add self-rising flour and stir until batter is no longer dry or sticky but fully moistened, about 1 minute. Rest batter for 3 to 5 minutes before frying.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Transfer 6 heaping spoonfuls of batter into the hot oil, and fry for 90 seconds. Carefully tip fritters over to the other side and fry 90 seconds more. Flip again, and cook 1 minute more.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Remove to cool on a rack until just barely warm.</li>
        <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>To make Bourbon syrup, combine 1/4 cup sugar, water, and Bourbon in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Boil for 1 minute, and remove from heat. Cool to room temperature. (You can make syrup ahead and refrigerate until needed. This is a very light syrup, so if you want something a little thicker you can boil for an extra minute.)</li>
        <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Serve fritters with vanilla ice cream and Bourbon syrup.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Cook's Notes:</h2>
    <p><b>You can use frozen or canned peaches if fresh peaches aren't available. If using frozen peaches, thaw and drain very well and chop before sugaring. If using canned peaches, skip the sugar and just add a few tablespoons of the syrup from the can to chopped peaches.</b></p>
